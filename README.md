## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify the reasons behind customer churn, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates. By combining SQL for data extraction and preprocessing, Python for in-depth data analysis and machine learning, and Power BI for visualizing insights, this project aims to help the business improve customer retention and satisfaction.

Churn occurs when customers stop using a service or discontinue their subscription. Understanding the factors leading to churn can help the company implement targeted retention strategies to minimize customer losses and enhance long-term loyalty.
